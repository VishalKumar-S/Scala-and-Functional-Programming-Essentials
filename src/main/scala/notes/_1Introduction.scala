Scala has val - which is used to create immutable variables, simlart to final in Java. var is used to create mutable variabbesl. Mentioning the type in variabels is optional in Scala.   compielr takes care fo the type, evn if we didnt mention. The varaible type is knwon by hte compielr, absed on the rihgt hand side expression, and the return type of hte function is known by the implementation. if we uneed to sue long or float or doubtl mention L,f,d explciity to teh valeu fot he viabel, so tht the compielr would know which type we r reffering to. in Scala, it is compulsory to explicitly mention the type of each parameter in the method parameters.. Semicolon is optional if we sue signle epxpression in a line in Scalca.It is only needded if we use multiple expressions in a single line. Val is mostly used, instead of var in Scala, since\n Functions in Purely Functional Programming Languages are exactly like Functions in Mathematics: they produce a result value based on their argument values and only based on their argument values.\n A Side-Effect (often just called Effect) is everything else. I.e. everything that is not reading the arguments and returning a result is a Side-Effect. These include:\n      - Modifying variables outside its scope\n      - I/O operations (reading/writing files, network calls)\n      - Printing to console\n      - Throwing exceptions\n      - Modifying data structures\n\n      In functional programming, the goal is to minimize side effects because:\n      - Predictability: Functions without side effects always produce the same output for the same input\n      - Testability: Pure functions (no side effects) are easier to test\n      - Reasoning: Code is easier to understand and debug\n      - Concurrency: Code without side effects is safer in multi-threaded environments\n\n      In functional programming with Scala, you typically:\n      - Use immutable data structures\n      - Return new values instead of modifying existing ones\n      - Make functions depend only on their inputs\n      - Keep side effects at the 'edges' of your program\n\n      This approach leads to code that's easier to reason about and less prone to bugs, especially in complex systems.\"\"\"")

IN scala adn fucntional programming in general, we wont prefer using  instructions. We only prefer using expressions. Here, IF - is an expression in Scala i.e returns a value. Using for/while loop,s which r commonly used in other iterative programmign language liek java or python are not not recommedned to use in Scala, these are considered as bad practice for functional programming, as using them in scala, leads to side effects. All instructions r side effects. In Scala, side effects are also considered to be expressions, but which returns a Unit, instead fo a value. Unit is similar to vodi in other programming languages, which means, it returns something not useful. Almost everything you write in Scala code is an expression that returns a value, including things that perform side effects. The exceptions are structural definitions like class, import, package, etc. e.,g in Java, if staememtn is an conditioanl statement,it wont return anything, but in Scala, u can assion the if statement to a variabel adn it returns a value.")

SO, for large values e.g, 5000, we cant find factorail, unlike iteration loop, it leads tos tack overflow error. So, the solution is to use Tail recursion, which  is a specific type of recursion in which the recursive call is the last operation performed by a function before returning its result. This makes tail-recursive functions more memory-efficient because the compiler can optimize them using tail-call elimination, which avoids adding additional stack frames for each recursive call.In tail recursion:\nThe result of the recursive call is directly returned, without any further computation after the call. The function doesn't need to \"remember\" the previous state, allowing optimization. In the factorialTailRec, the recursive call (factorialTailRec(n - 1, accumulator * n)) is the last operation, making it tail-recursive. In Non-Tail-Recursive Function, the multiplication (n * factorialNonTailRec(n - 1)) occurs after the recursive call, making it not tail-recursive. To identify a recursive function is tailre cursion or not, check if the function could theoretically be rewritten as an iterative loop (this is often a hallmark of tail recursion). or use hte annotator @tailrec abvoe a recursive function. If that recursiv function is non-tail,it will lead to compiler issue. SO, Tail recursion is optimized by the compiler, using constant stack space instead of growing the stack with each recursive call and can handle larger inputs without causing stack overflow. Note, althouhg tehoerietically, this most imperatie languages (c++,java,pytohn,javascript) wont support this Tail compoiler optimsiation (TCO), they create new stack frame, since imperative lanagues expects \"step-by-step execution\", keeping the call stack alive for debugging and tracing. only functional programming(Haskell, Schema,  Scala) langauges only support this TCO, Languge differnce :\\n Pure Functional = No changing variables, recursion, immutable data everywhere (Haskell, Scheme). Multi-Paradigm = Mix of both Functional + Object-oriented (Scala, Python, JavaScript, C#). Pure Imperative = Focus only on commands and changing states (C, old-school Java). Even though Python/Java/JS allow functional style, their main programming culture is imperative â†’ so no TCO. (since peiple woudl run a for i in range(100000), instead of using recursion, so  those langauges dont cae about optimsiign recursion), whereas Scala leans heavily functional by design, so TCO is a must. i.e Scala cares about recursion, Python/JS/Java care about loops.")
